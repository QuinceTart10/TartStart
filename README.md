# TartStart

Stupidly simple and lightweight start page

## Usage

Simply clone this repository anywhere you want and set [start.html](start.html) as your browser's homepage.
You can also put it on a web server if you wish so.

If you want to set it as your new tab page, you need to use an extension, such as [Custom New Tab Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/) (for Firefox) or [Custom New Tab URL](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) (for Chrome) and put the page on a web server.

## Configuration

Modify the variables in [style.css](style.css) as described in the file itself.
